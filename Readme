**🩸 Blood Cell Detection and Counting using Deep Learning**

📌 Project Overview
Manual blood cell analysis under a microscope is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires expert intervention. This project automates the detection 
and counting of blood cells from microscopic images using deep learning–based object detection.
The model accurately identifies and counts different blood cell types, helping reduce human effort and improving efficiency in medical image analysis.
